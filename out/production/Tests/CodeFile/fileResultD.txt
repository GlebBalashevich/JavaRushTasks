Provides classes and interfaces for handling text, dates, numbers, and messages in a manner independent of natural languages. 
This means your main application or applet can be written to be language-independent, and it can rely upon separate, dynamically-linked localized resources. 
This allows the flexibility of adding localizations for new localizations at any time.
